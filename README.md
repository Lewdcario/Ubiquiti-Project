# Ubiquiti Project

## Getting Started

First, install and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

*As the font appears to be in a demo mode, some characters show up with a "demo" ASCII code.*

I would do a few things if I had more time:

* Organise the colours in tailwind.config.css
* Setup dark and light themes properly
* Setup more thorough tests
* Make improvements to my `classnames` logic in various components and take farther considerations towards wider reusability
* Look into animations between page transitions
* Migrate more fully to Next.js@13, which uses the "apps" directory
* Reconsider the font or spend more time looking for a full font, obviously this would be less of an issue in a corporate setting where we would likely purchase the font instead
