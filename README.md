# Ubiquiti Project

## Getting Started

First, install and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

*As the font appears to be in a demo mode, some characters show up with a "demo" ASCII code.*

I would do a few things if I had more time:

* Organise the colours in tailwind.config.css
* Setup dark and light themes properly
* Mobile
* Setup more thorough tests
* Make improvements to my `classnames` logic in various components and take farther considerations towards wider reusability
* Look into animations between page transitions, dropdowns and the like
* Migrate more fully to Next.js@13, which uses the "apps" directory
* Reconsider the font or spend more time looking for a full font, obviously this would be less of an issue in a corporate setting where we would likely purchase the font instead
* Host on HTTPs, which is probably trivial for the assignment anyhow
* Ensuring compatibility on other and older browsers
* Address TODOs around the project, which aren't many
* Handle dropdowns and clicking on `Link`s better
* Fix the meta tags - they don't seem to be working entirely properly
* Animate the Accordion component
* Remove axios and the progress feature, that was a mistake
