# Ubiquiti Project

## Getting Started

First, install and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

I would do a few things if I had more time:

* Organise the colours in tailwind.config.css
* Setup dark and light themes properly
* Setup more thorough tests
* Make improvements to my `classnames` logic in various components and take farther considerations towards wider reusability
